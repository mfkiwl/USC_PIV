This repo contains some of the Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV) codes developed at USC. As it stands, this repo is a haphazard collection of seemingly random Matlab codes. Over the course of 2014 (between multiple projects and teaching commitments), I've been working on turning it into something more useful. In the mean time, feel free to take a look at the codes, feed it to your pet (not advised!), or modify it for your own use (definitely encouraged!). 

Note: The readimx4matlab libraries required to read image data acquired through DaVis are provided in this repo for your convenience. Thanks to LaVision ( http://www.lavision.de/en/ ) for making them available for free. Check them out for all of your PIV needs!
