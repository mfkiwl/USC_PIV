This repo contains some of the Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV) codes developed by me at USC. Initially, it is going to be a haphazard collection of seemingly random Matlab codes. Over time, I hope to streamline this mess and make a viable PIV package out of it. Feel free to take a look at the codes, despite the somewhat cryptic filenames the codes themselves are somewhat well documented.
