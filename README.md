USC PIV (Beta) - Particle Image Velocimetry codes

This repo contains some of the Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV) codes I have been developing over the last year. As it stands, this repo is a haphazard collection of seemingly random Matlab codes. Over the course of this year (between multiple projects and teaching commitments), I hope to turn it into something more useful. My goal is to eventually design a clean GUI that will call these codes through a nice, user-friendly interface. In the mean time, feel free to take a look at the various sub-routines (you migth even find some of them handy!), modify it for your own use (definitely encouraged!), and send me a pull request if you make any changes. 

Note:

[1] A good starting point would be xcorrPIV.m which performs the initial step of calculating displacement and velocity fields. 
[2] All of the codes are written in Matlab. Signal Processing Toolbox is required for cross-correlation.  
[3] The readimx4matlab libraries required to read image data acquired through DaVis are provided in this repo for your convenience. Thanks to LaVision ( http://www.lavision.de/en/ ) for making them available for free. Check them out for all of your PIV needs.
