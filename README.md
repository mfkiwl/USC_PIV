This repo contains some of the Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV) codes developed by me at USC. It also contains some code from other people I've collaborated with over the years, but these are fairly well marked and they own the rights to those codes. Initially this repo is going to be a haphazard collection of seemingly random Matlab codes. Over time I hope to streamline this mess and make a viable PIV package out of it. Feel free to take a look at the codes, despite the somewhat cryptic filenames the codes themselves are well documented.
