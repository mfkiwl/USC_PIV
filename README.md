This repo contains some of the Particle Image Velocimetry(PIV) codes developed at USC. Initially this repo is going to be a haphazard collection of seemingly random Matlab codes. Over the course of 2014 I hope to streamline this mess and make a viable PIV package out of it. Feel free to take a look at the codes and fork it if you want.
